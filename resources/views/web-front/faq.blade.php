    Why is there a $10 enquiry fee for every enquiry I send through the plaXorm?<br/>
The nominal fee is to prevent indiscriminate sending of casual enquiries to celebriYes. User can select up to 10 celebriYes per enquiry. The enquiry
fee applies for the one month free trial. The subscripYon plans come with a fixed number of enquiries at no extra cost.
